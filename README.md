Stuff I Learned...
## WEEK 1:

- DisMath deals more with logical truths and that it requires minimal computations.
- It isn't boring at all as opposed to what I first thought.
- The definition and examples of propositions
- Logical connectives

## WEEK 2:

- Realization: You don't just breeze through the course. You have to pay attention and think.
- Nested logical connectives
- Implication can turn out to be quit confusing.
- Truth tables are easy to learn. I prefer using it more than equivalences for proving.
