Stuff I Learned...

## WEEK 1:

- DisMath deals more with logical truths and that it requires minimal computations.
- It isn't boring at all as opposed to what I first thought.
- The definition and examples of propositions
- Logical connectives

## WEEK 2:

- Realization: You don't just breeze through the course. You have to pay attention and think.
- Nested logical connectives
- Implication can turn out to be quite confusing.
- Truth tables are easy to learn. I prefer using it more than equivalences for proving.

## WEEK 3:

- An argument's validity doesn't tell us anything about its truth value.
- Fallacies are invalid arguments.
- Our class was introduced to quantifiers such as universal and existential.
- Universal quantifiers tell us that the premise is true for ALL possible cases. To disprove, state that there exists ¬premise.
- Existential quantifiers tells us the premise holds true for at least one instance. To disprove, show ¬premise for all possible cases.

## WEEK 4:

- Rules of Inference are yet another set of tools for proving.
- We can use atomic propositions to break down a problem according to important keywords then proceed with proving.
- We were introduced to the methods of proving such as direct proof and proof by contrapositive.

## WEEK 5:

- For week 5, we started off from where the discussion ended from the previous week and discussed other proving methods.
- Proving via contradiction is done by showing that the negation of a premise leads to a contradiction.
- I have previously encountered mathematical induction in my ENGALG2 course. It consists of the basis step and inductive step.
- Recursive functions can be tricky at first. All there is to remember is that the next value for the function depends on the previous value.

## WEEK 6:

- The basics regarding sets.
- I agree with our professor telling us that this particular session is a temporary breather from all the difficult topics so far.
- Union, intersection, and symmetrical difference
- Set identities. I told myself that in order to learn these new set of rules, I must indoctrinate myself with either logical equivalences or set identities then make do with the other by means of their patterns. This works because of their similarity.
